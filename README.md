# Indigenous_Data_OHDSI

## Scope

This repository has been set up in order to manage the development of a proposal for the identification of Indigenous peoples in the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model. 

The initial scope of this work is specific to the Australian chapter only, and thus will focus on supporting current best practice for identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Where possible, however, all effort will be made to ensure that the proposal put forward will be adaptable to other settings.
